# Theory2Video Constitution
*AI-Powered Mathematical Video Generation Platform*

## Core Principles

### I. Performance-First Architecture
**Speed and parallelization are non-negotiable requirements**
- All pipeline components must support asynchronous execution and parallel processing
- Scene rendering operations must be designed for concurrent execution with configurable limits
- Video generation time must be optimized through intelligent caching, GPU acceleration, and parallel workflows
- Performance bottlenecks must be identified, measured, and eliminated systematically
- Default configurations must prioritize speed without sacrificing quality

### II. Modular Agent Composition
**Each agent component is independently testable and replaceable**
- Video generation pipeline consists of discrete, composable agents: Planner, CodeGenerator, Renderer
- Each agent exposes clear interfaces following dependency injection patterns
- Agent workflows can be configured, extended, or replaced without system-wide changes
- Components must be stateless where possible to enable horizontal scaling
- Agent configurations must be externalized and environment-specific

### III. Robust Error Handling & Recovery
**System must gracefully handle failures and provide intelligent retry mechanisms**
- Multi-level error handling: scene-level, pipeline-level, and system-level recovery
- Intelligent retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Visual error detection and automatic code correction capabilities
- Comprehensive logging with distributed tracing for debugging complex workflows
- Graceful degradation: partial failures should not block entire video generation

### IV. Quality-Driven Output
**Mathematical accuracy and visual excellence are paramount**
- All generated Manim code must be syntactically correct and mathematically sound
- Visual output must be validated through automated screenshot comparison
- Audio synchronization with visual elements must be precise
- Scene transitions must be smooth and contextually appropriate
- Quality metrics must be measurable and continuously monitored

### V. Scalable Resource Management
**System must efficiently handle concurrent video generation requests**
- Configurable concurrency limits for different resource types (CPU, GPU, memory)
- Intelligent resource allocation based on job complexity and system capacity
- Queue management with priority scheduling for different job types
- Resource cleanup and garbage collection to prevent memory leaks
- Support for both local and distributed execution environments

## Technical Standards

### Development Workflow
- **Test-Driven Development**: Unit tests required before implementation, integration tests for agent interactions
- **Asynchronous by Default**: All I/O operations and long-running tasks must be async
- **Configuration Management**: External configuration files with environment overrides
- **Observability**: Structured logging, metrics collection, and distributed tracing
- **Code Quality**: Type hints, docstrings, and automated linting/formatting

### Performance Requirements
- **Video Generation Time**: Target <5 minutes for 10-minute educational video on standard hardware
- **Concurrent Jobs**: Support minimum 5 concurrent video generation jobs
- **Memory Usage**: Maximum 8GB RAM per video generation job
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Achieve >70% cache hit rate for repeated similar content
- **Error Recovery**: <10% job failure rate with automatic retry capabilities

### API & Integration Standards
- **REST API**: All functionality accessible via RESTful endpoints
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time progress updates for long-running jobs
- **Model Agnostic**: Support multiple LLM providers with unified interface
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system for custom rendering backends
- **Export Formats**: Multiple output formats (MP4, WebM) with quality presets

## Security & Compliance

### Data Protection
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- **API Key Management**: Secure storage and rotation of external service credentials
- **Content Isolation**: Each video generation job runs in isolated environment
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all system operations
- **Privacy by Design**: No persistent storage of user content without explicit consent

### Operational Security
- **Container Security**: All services run in containerized environments with minimal privileges
- **Network Isolation**: Service-to-service communication through defined interfaces only
- **Dependency Management**: Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automated backups with tested disaster recovery procedures
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for administrative functions

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: >90% code coverage for all core components
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end pipeline testing with known mathematical examples
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing with concurrent job scenarios
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Automated comparison of generated video frames
- **Chaos Engineering**: Fault injection testing for resilience validation

### Monitoring & Alerting
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, GPU utilization monitoring
- **Business Metrics**: Job completion rates, average processing time, error rates
- **Health Checks**: Automated service health monitoring with alerting
- **Performance Dashboards**: Real-time visibility into system performance
- **Log Analysis**: Centralized log aggregation and analysis tools

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, interface segregation
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor injection for testability and flexibility
- **Factory Patterns**: Component factories for different execution contexts
- **Service Layer**: Clear separation between business logic and infrastructure
- **Configuration Objects**: Type-safe configuration classes with validation

### Documentation Requirements
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger specifications for all endpoints
- **Architecture Documentation**: System design documents with component diagrams
- **Deployment Guides**: Step-by-step deployment and configuration instructions
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Common issues and resolution procedures
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimization guides for different deployment scenarios

## Governance

### Change Management
- Constitution supersedes all other development practices and standards
- Major architectural changes require architecture review board approval
- Performance regressions are blocking issues that must be resolved before release
- All agents must maintain backward compatibility unless breaking changes are explicitly approved
- Security vulnerabilities take highest priority and must be patched within 24 hours

### Release Process
- **Semantic Versioning**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH versioning with clear compatibility guarantees
- **Feature Flags**: New functionality deployed behind feature flags for gradual rollout
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments with automated rollback capability
- **Performance Validation**: Automated performance tests must pass before production deployment
- **Monitoring Windows**: 24-hour monitoring period after each production release

### Continuous Improvement
- Weekly performance reviews with optimization opportunities identification
- Monthly architecture reviews to assess system scalability and reliability
- Quarterly technology stack evaluations for potential upgrades
- Annual constitution review and amendment process
- Post-incident reviews with action items for system improvements
